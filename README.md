Core Topics
1. Machine Learning
Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on building systems that can learn from data. It includes techniques such as:

Supervised Learning: Learning from labeled data (e.g., classification, regression).
Unsupervised Learning: Learning from unlabeled data (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction).
Algorithms: Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, k-NN, etc.
2. Deep Learning
Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that deals with neural networks with many layers, allowing machines to learn from vast amounts of data.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs): A system of interconnected nodes or neurons.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Often used in image processing tasks.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Useful for sequential data like time series or natural language.
3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
NLP is the study of how machines understand and generate human language. Key areas include:

Tokenization: Breaking down text into individual components (words or subwords).
Text Classification: Categorizing text into different classes.
Sentiment Analysis: Determining the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) in a text.
4. Computer Vision
Computer Vision focuses on enabling machines to interpret and make decisions based on visual data. Key tasks include:

Image Classification: Assigning labels to an image.
Object Detection: Identifying objects within an image.
Image Segmentation: Partitioning an image into segments based on object boundaries.
5. Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement Learning (RL) involves an agent learning to make decisions by interacting with an environment. Key concepts include:

Exploration vs. Exploitation: Balancing between exploring new actions and exploiting known actions that yield high rewards.
Markov Decision Process (MDP): A mathematical framework for modeling decision-making.
Usage
This repository includes code and Jupyter notebooks to help you understand the concepts better. To run the examples:
