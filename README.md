# Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence by machines. AI has evolved significantly in recent years and now encompasses a broad range of subfields, including Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Computer Vision.

This repository aims to provide an overview of the essential concepts, algorithms, and applications of AI, along with hands-on examples.

# Installation
To get started with the repository, follow these instructions:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-fundamentals.git

# Install the required packages:

If you're using Python, the required dependencies can be installed using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt
# Core Topics

# 1. Machine Learning
Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on building systems that can learn from data. It includes techniques such as:

# Supervised Learning:
Learning from labeled data (e.g., classification, regression).
# Unsupervised Learning: 
Learning from unlabeled data (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction).
# Algorithms: Decision 
Trees, Support Vector Machines, k-NN, etc.

# 2. Deep Learning
Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that deals with neural networks with many layers, allowing machines to learn from vast amounts of data.

# Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs): 
A system of interconnected nodes or neurons.
# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):
Often used in image processing tasks.
# Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): 
Useful for sequential data like time series or natural language.

# 3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
NLP is the study of how machines understand and generate human language. Key areas include:

# Tokenization:
Breaking down text into individual components (words or subwords).
# Text Classification: 
Categorizing text into different classes.
# Sentiment Analysis:
Determining the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) in a text.

# 4. Computer Vision
Computer Vision focuses on enabling machines to interpret and make decisions based on visual data. Key tasks include:

# Image Classification: 
Assigning labels to an image.
# Object Detection: 
Identifying objects within an image.
# Image Segmentation: 
Partitioning an image into segments based on object boundaries.

# 5. Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement Learning (RL) involves an agent learning to make decisions by interacting with an environment. Key concepts include:

# Exploration vs. Exploitation:
Balancing between exploring new actions and exploiting known actions that yield high rewards.
# Markov Decision Process (MDP):
A mathematical framework for modeling decision-making.

# Usage
This repository includes code and Jupyter notebooks to help you understand the concepts better. To run the examples:

Navigate to the folder of interest, e.g., machine-learning/ or deep-learning/.
Open the relevant notebook:

jupyter notebook example-notebook.ipynb

# Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to experiment with code and visualizations.
